## Lab 3 | Maps, File I/O, and Testing
### Feature Tasks
- Analyzing Weather Data: Use the October Seattle weather data above. Iterate through all of the data to find the min and max values. Use a HashSet of type Integer to keep track of all the unique temperatures seen. Finally, iterate from the min temp to the max temp and create a String containing any temperature not seen during the month. Return that String.
