##Lab 6
###Tasks
- We were tasked with creating a restaurant class and the functionality to review that restaurant.
- Add a review to be associated with that restaurant
- Both the restaurant and the review had different necessary data
###Method
- I used composition and by setting the name of the restaurant in the review = to the restaurant instance
- Constructors for each class were tested to make sure an instance could be made using the toString appropriate. 
- Make sure the review was added to the ArrayList for the specific restaurant and accurately reflected the number of to
total reviews and the avg number of total stars.

##Lab 7 
###Tasks
- Make a Shop and a Theater class that have constructor and can be reviewed. 
- Theater also had an optional movie field
- Each Theater had a list of movies being shown and a method to add or remove from that list.
###Method
-Again used composition. 
-Test all the functionality


##Testing the code
- Clone the Repo from https://github.com/lhchandler4/java-fundamentals
